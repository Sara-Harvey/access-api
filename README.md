# access-api
Simple Python to call a json API

The non-profit MuckRock helps journalists and citizens access public information using Freedom of Information Act requests. So, I called the statistics on FOIA requests from their API, accessible without a token.

For more information, visit, https://www.muckrock.com/api/, and their public repository of example code, https://github.com/MuckRock/API-examples.
